Solution of lab manual

P2 Create a calculator process which accepts equations from other process and returns the results.
Note: Use inter process communication system calls, Pipe/fifo or message queue.

p4:  Process in a particular os make multiple requests. This OS uses a banker'a Algorithm designed for a single resourses class to implements deadlock 
avoidance as follows. When a process requests class to implement deadlock avoidances as follows: When a process requests resources units of some n 
resource classes, the requests is viewed as a set of n single requests: e.q a multiple requests (2,1,3) would be viewed as three single requets (2,0,0),(0,1,0) 
and (0,0,3). The multiple requsts are granted only if each single requets would have been granted in the current allocation state of the system. Is this sound approach
 to deadlock acoidances? Justify your answer by giving one safe sequences. 


p5: A new computer sytem with Linux based operating system needs to be verified for specification. Write a C program to display Memory, Processors, Cache extra information.
Note: Use meminfo and CPU info from proc directory.
